    content: `## What a Rating of 2 Actually Means

A food hygiene rating of 2 — officially described as "Improvement Necessary" — sits in the lower third of the Food Standards Agency's 0–5 scale. It tells Environmental Health Officers that your business broadly understands food safety principles, but there are significant gaps that need addressing before your premises can be considered safe and well-managed.

The rating is determined by scores across three areas: food handling and hygiene (scored 0–25, where lower is better), the structural condition of your premises (0–25), and confidence in management and record keeping (0–30). A rating of 2 typically means you scored poorly in at least one of these areas, with the management category often being the primary drag on overall scores for small businesses.

## How Inspectors Decide Your Score

Environmental Health Officers from your local authority conduct unannounced inspections based on a standardised framework. They assess observable conditions at the time of their visit, meaning a bad day can result in a low score even if your standards are usually higher. However, the inspection also examines documentation, training records, and management systems — areas where consistent effort is visible regardless of the day.

The hygiene score covers how food is handled, prepared, cooked, reheated, cooled, and stored. Inspectors look for evidence of cross-contamination controls, temperature monitoring, and personal hygiene practices. They will check fridge temperatures, observe food preparation, and look at how raw and cooked foods are separated.

The structural score covers the physical condition and cleanliness of your premises: walls, floors, ceilings, equipment, ventilation, lighting, and pest control measures. Cracks in walls, damaged flooring, inadequate ventilation, and evidence of pest activity all reduce this score.

The management score — often the most influential on your overall rating — covers your food safety management system. Inspectors want to see an active Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) pack or HACCP-based system with dated entries, temperature logs, cleaning schedules, training records, and evidence that you are proactively managing food safety rather than reacting to problems.

## The Real Business Impact

A rating of 2 has concrete commercial consequences that go beyond reputation. Delivery platforms have implemented rating thresholds: Deliveroo and Just Eat have removed zero-rated restaurants, and Uber Eats requires a minimum rating of 2 — meaning your business is at the threshold of removal. For takeaways that generate 30–50% of revenue through delivery platforms, this is an existential risk.

Consumer awareness is also significant. Research shows that 73% of consumers check food hygiene ratings before eating at a new establishment. Your rating is displayed on the FSA's public website, which appears prominently in Google search results for your business name. In Wales, you are legally required to display your rating at your premises — meaning walk-in customers see it before they enter.

Additionally, persistent low ratings trigger more frequent inspections from your local authority, increasing the chance of enforcement action. Environmental Health Officers keep a closer eye on businesses rated 0–2, and repeated low scores can lead to formal improvement notices or, in extreme cases, prosecution under the Food Safety Act 1990.

## The Difference Between a 2 and a 3

The jump from 2 to 3 is often smaller than businesses expect. A rating of 3 ("Generally Satisfactory") typically requires bringing your worst-scoring area up to an acceptable level. For many businesses, this means completing their SFBB documentation, implementing a temperature monitoring routine, and addressing one or two structural issues.

The FSA scoring bands mean that even modest improvements in your lowest-scoring area can push your overall rating up. If your management score is dragging you down — which is the most common scenario — getting your SFBB pack fully completed and maintained can be enough to lift your rating by one or two points.

## How to Improve From a 2

The first step is understanding your specific score breakdown. Each area has a numerical score, and knowing where you lost the most marks tells you where to focus. The FSA publishes these breakdowns on their website, and your local authority can provide the detailed inspection report on request.

Focus on the area where you scored worst. If it is management (the most common for a rating of 2), start with implementing or completing your SFBB pack. Download it free from food.gov.uk, fill in every section with dated entries, and maintain it daily. This single action addresses the most common reason for low management scores.

If your hygiene score is the issue, focus on temperature control and cross-contamination. Buy a calibrated probe thermometer, record fridge and cooking temperatures twice daily, and implement colour-coded chopping boards. These are visible, concrete actions that inspectors can verify immediately.

For structural issues, prioritise cleanliness over cosmetics. A deep clean of the kitchen, including behind equipment and inside extractors, is more impactful than repainting walls. Fix any pest entry points, replace damaged flooring or wall tiles, and ensure ventilation is working properly.

## Requesting a Reinspection

You do not need to wait for the next scheduled inspection. Once you have made improvements, you can request a paid reinspection from your local authority. Fees typically range from £150 to £300, and most councils aim to conduct the reinspection within three months of your request.

Before requesting, ensure all improvements are complete and documented. Have your SFBB pack, temperature logs, cleaning schedules, and training records ready and displayed. First impressions matter — a visibly clean premises with organised paperwork signals competence before the inspector has even started their assessment.

    content: `## What Happens During a Food Hygiene Inspection

Food hygiene inspections in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are conducted by Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) employed by your local authority. Inspections are almost always unannounced — you will not receive advance notice. The inspector will arrive during normal business hours, identify themselves, and begin their assessment immediately. Inspections typically last between one and three hours, depending on the size and complexity of your business.

The inspection covers three areas that are scored independently: food handling and hygiene practices, the structural condition and cleanliness of your premises, and your confidence in management systems and documentation. Each area contributes to your overall Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) score on the 0–5 scale.

## Food Handling and Hygiene (Score: 0–25)

This category assesses how food is managed throughout its journey in your premises. Inspectors observe live operations wherever possible.

**Temperature control** is the single most scrutinised element. Inspectors will check fridge temperatures (must be between 1°C and 5°C), freezer temperatures (below -18°C), hot-held food temperatures (above 63°C), and will often ask to see your temperature monitoring records. They may use their own calibrated probe thermometer to verify food temperatures independently.

**Cross-contamination controls** are checked by observing food storage arrangements (raw meat must be stored below ready-to-eat food), equipment separation (colour-coded boards and utensils), and handling practices. Inspectors look for evidence that raw and cooked foods are never prepared using the same surfaces or tools without thorough cleaning and disinfection between uses.

**Cooking and reheating** procedures are assessed by checking that food reaches safe core temperatures. For cooking, the core temperature should reach 75°C for at least two minutes (or equivalent time-temperature combinations). Reheated food must reach 82°C in Scotland and 75°C in England and Wales. Rice, which poses specific Bacillus cereus risks, receives particular attention.

**Personal hygiene** is observed throughout: handwashing frequency and technique, use of handwash basins (which must have hot and cold water, soap, and paper towels — never cloth towels), hair covering, clean clothing, and absence of uncovered cuts or sores. Inspectors also note whether handwash basins are accessible and not blocked by equipment.

**Food storage and stock rotation** covers correct labelling, use-by date compliance, and first-in-first-out stock management. Inspectors may check your walk-in chiller or dry storage for expired items, unlabelled containers, or food stored directly on the floor.

## Structural Condition and Cleanliness (Score: 0–25)

This assesses the physical environment in which food is prepared and served.

**Cleanliness** is the primary consideration. Inspectors examine all surfaces including walls, floors, ceilings, equipment (inside and out), extraction canopies, light fittings, and storage areas. Grease accumulation, mould, and visible dirt are all noted. The standard is not perfection but a consistent level of cleanliness that prevents contamination.

**Physical condition** covers the integrity of surfaces. Walls must be smooth, impervious, and free from cracks or peeling paint. Floors must be in good repair, non-absorbent, and easy to clean. Ceiling tiles must be intact, and equipment must be in good working order. Any damage that creates harbourage for pests or makes cleaning difficult is a concern.

**Ventilation and extraction** systems are checked for cleanliness and function. Grease filters must be clean, and extraction systems must effectively remove steam, fumes, and heat. Poor ventilation leads to condensation, which in turn leads to mould and bacterial growth.

**Pest control** is assessed by looking for evidence of pest activity (droppings, gnaw marks, dead insects), pest entry points (gaps around pipes, doors, windows), and pest prevention measures (fly screens, door strips, sealed food storage). Inspectors will ask about your pest control arrangements — whether you have a contract with a pest control company and can produce inspection reports.

**Waste management** covers bin locations, bin condition, waste removal frequency, and separation of food waste from other waste. External waste areas must be clean and not attract pests.

## Confidence in Management (Score: 0–30)

This is the highest-weighted category and assesses whether you are proactively managing food safety.

**Food safety management system** is the cornerstone. Inspectors want to see an active, maintained Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) pack or HACCP-based system. The key word is "active" — a blank or pristine SFBB pack signals that it is not being used. Dated entries, completed opening and closing checks, and evidence of regular 4-weekly reviews are what inspectors value.

**Temperature records** should be maintained in a bound logbook or consistent digital format. Records should show fridge, freezer, and cooking temperatures taken at least twice daily. Missing dates or gaps in records are noted as evidence of inconsistent management.

**Cleaning schedules** should specify what is cleaned, how often, by whom, and with what product. A sign-off column shows that tasks are actually being completed. Inspectors distinguish between a schedule that exists on paper and one that is actively followed.

**Staff training records** should demonstrate that all food handlers have received appropriate training. Level 2 Food Hygiene certificates for all food handlers and Level 3 for supervisors are the expected standard. Inspectors also look for allergen awareness training records, particularly since Natasha's Law introduced enhanced labelling requirements for prepacked for direct sale (PPDS) food.

**Allergen management** covers your allergen information provision (menus, allergen matrices, staff knowledge), ingredient tracking, and procedures for handling allergen-related customer queries. Under Natasha's Law (in force since October 2021), all PPDS food must display full ingredient lists with the 14 major allergens emphasised. This is a legal requirement and failure to comply is both a food safety and a legal risk.

**Supplier records** should demonstrate traceability. Inspectors may ask to see delivery receipts, supplier audit documents, or evidence that you verify food is from approved sources. This is particularly important for businesses that handle raw meat, fish, or specialist ingredients.

## How to Prepare

The best preparation is consistency. Inspectors assess what they observe on the day, but documentation tells them whether your standards are maintained over time. A perfectly clean kitchen with no documentation is less reassuring than a well-documented kitchen with minor cleaning to complete.

Start with your SFBB pack: ensure every section is completed with dated entries, and that your 4-weekly review is up to date. Then verify all temperature logs are current, cleaning schedules are signed off, and training records are filed and accessible.

On the physical side, conduct a self-inspection: check behind equipment, inside extractors, under fixtures, and in storage areas. Fix any structural issues that are within your capability. For anything requiring professional repair, document that you are aware of the issue and have a plan to address it — inspectors note proactive management even when the physical fix is pending.

    content: `## You Don't Have to Wait for the Next Scheduled Inspection

Many food business owners assume they must wait for their local authority's regular inspection cycle — which can be anywhere from six months to three years depending on your risk category. In reality, you have the right to request a reinspection at any time after making improvements. This is called a "right to request a re-rating" and is a formal part of the Food Hygiene Rating Scheme.

The process was established under the Brand Standard revision to the FHRS and is available to all food businesses in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Scotland operates a separate Food Hygiene Information Scheme (FHIS) with different procedures.

## Step 1: Make Your Improvements First

Before requesting a reinspection, complete all the improvements identified in your last inspection. Your local authority will have provided a letter or report detailing what needs to change. If you did not receive this or have lost it, contact your local authority's Environmental Health department to request a copy.

Do not request a reinspection until you are genuinely confident that all issues have been addressed. An unsuccessful reinspection does not just waste your fee — it can damage your credibility with the inspector and may result in even closer scrutiny at future visits. Inspectors remember businesses that request reinspection without making meaningful changes.

Focus on documentation first, as this is the area where most businesses score poorly and where improvement is most visible. A fully completed SFBB pack with dated entries, current temperature logs, up-to-date cleaning schedules, and filed training records demonstrate systematic improvement that inspectors value.

## Step 2: Contact Your Local Authority

Every local authority has an Environmental Health department that handles food hygiene inspections. You can find your local authority and their contact details on the Food Standards Agency website at ratings.food.gov.uk.

Contact them by email or phone and state that you wish to request a paid reinspection under the FHRS right to re-rating. Some councils have an online form for this purpose. You will need to provide your establishment name, FHRS ID (found on your current rating certificate or the FSA website), and a brief description of the improvements you have made.

## Step 3: Pay the Reinspection Fee

Reinspection fees are set by each local authority and typically range from £150 to £300. Some councils charge more for larger premises or complex operations. The fee covers the cost of the officer's time and administration — it is not a penalty or fine.

Payment is usually required before the inspection is scheduled. Most councils accept bank transfer, card payment, or sometimes cheque. Ensure you have the fee payment confirmed before expecting an inspection date.

## Step 4: Prepare for the Visit

Reinspections follow exactly the same process as routine inspections — they are unannounced, comprehensive, and scored against the same criteria. The only difference is that you requested it and paid for it.

Preparation should include a thorough deep clean of all food preparation areas, checking all documentation is current and accessible, verifying all staff have the required training certificates, confirming all temperature monitoring systems are working, and ensuring all structural repairs are complete.

On the day, have the following ready and accessible: your SFBB pack or HACCP documentation, temperature logs for the previous four weeks minimum, your current cleaning schedule with sign-offs, staff training records and certificates, pest control reports, and supplier records.

## Typical Timelines

Most local authorities aim to conduct reinspections within three months of receiving your request and payment. Some are faster, particularly if they have capacity. However, Environmental Health departments are often under-resourced, so delays are possible.

You cannot choose the date or time of your reinspection. It will be unannounced, just like a routine inspection. This means your standards must be maintained consistently — not just prepared for a specific date.

## What If the Result Is Disappointing

If your reinspection does not result in the improved rating you hoped for, you have two options. You can appeal the rating through the FHRS appeals process within 21 days (this only applies if you believe the process was flawed, not if you disagree with the judgement). Alternatively, you can make further improvements and request another reinspection — though you will need to pay the fee again.

The most common reason for disappointing reinspection results is that documentation improvements were made but physical or procedural improvements were not sustained. Inspectors look for evidence of consistent practice, not just a one-off effort before the inspection.

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

At £150–300 for a reinspection, the cost is easily justified for most food businesses. Consider the revenue impact of a low rating: lost delivery platform listings (potentially thousands of pounds per month), reduced walk-in custom, and the reputational cost of a visible low rating. A single improved rating point can pay back the reinspection cost many times over.

For businesses on delivery platforms, the calculation is stark: Deliveroo removes businesses rated 0–1, and other platforms have similar thresholds. If delivery revenue represents even £1,000 per month, a £200 reinspection fee that restores platform access pays for itself within a week.

    content: `## What HACCP Actually Means

HACCP — Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points — sounds like something designed for food factories, not your small restaurant or takeaway. In practice, it is simply a structured way of identifying what could go wrong with food safety in your business and putting controls in place to prevent it. UK food law requires all food businesses to have a food safety management system based on HACCP principles, but for small businesses, the FSA provides a simplified version called Safer Food Better Business (SFBB).

The seven principles of HACCP are: identify hazards, determine critical control points, set critical limits, establish monitoring procedures, establish corrective actions, verify the system works, and keep records. For a small restaurant, this translates to: know what can make people ill, know where in your process you can prevent it, check it is working, and write it down.

## SFBB Is HACCP for Small Businesses

The Food Standards Agency created the Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) pack specifically for small food businesses that need to comply with HACCP requirements without the complexity of a full HACCP plan. The SFBB pack is free, available from food.gov.uk, and is the document that Environmental Health Officers expect to see during inspections of small businesses.

There are different SFBB packs for different business types: one for restaurants and takeaways, one for retail businesses, and one for childminders. Each pack is structured around "safe methods" — practical procedures written in plain English that cover the key food safety risks for that business type.

The pack has two main sections: safe methods (the procedures) and the diary (the record-keeping). Both must be completed and maintained. A completed safe methods section with an empty diary is not compliant — the diary is what proves you are actually following your procedures.

## Implementing SFBB: A Step-by-Step Guide

**Week 1: Get the pack and read it.** Download the SFBB pack for your business type from food.gov.uk or request a paper copy from your local authority. Read through all the safe methods. Many will describe practices you already follow — the task is to document them, not necessarily to change them.

**Week 2: Complete the safe methods.** Work through each safe method and tick the practices that apply to your business. Where a safe method does not apply (for example, you do not reheat food), mark it as "not applicable" and note why. The safe methods section should reflect what you actually do, not what you think inspectors want to hear.

**Week 3: Start the diary.** Begin filling in the diary section daily. This includes opening and closing checks, temperature records, and any problems and corrective actions. The diary is where most businesses fall down — it needs to be maintained every day, not filled in retrospectively before an inspection. Inspectors can tell the difference.

**Week 4 onwards: Maintain and review.** The SFBB pack includes a 4-weekly review section. Every four weeks, review your safe methods, check that procedures are still being followed, and update anything that has changed. Date and sign each review. This ongoing maintenance is what converts SFBB from a static document into an active food safety management system.

## Temperature Monitoring

Temperature control is the most critical control point for almost all food businesses. Incorrect temperatures allow bacterial growth that causes foodborne illness. Your SFBB diary should record:

Fridge temperatures twice daily. All fridges should operate between 1°C and 5°C. If a fridge reads above 5°C, investigate immediately: is it overloaded, is the door seal damaged, is the thermostat set correctly? Record the temperature and any corrective action taken.

Freezer temperatures once daily. Freezers should be below -18°C. Small fluctuations during defrost cycles are normal; sustained temperatures above -15°C indicate a problem.

Cooking temperatures for high-risk items. Use a calibrated probe thermometer to check the core temperature of cooked food. The core must reach 75°C for at least two minutes. For dishes that are cooked to order, establishing that your processes consistently achieve safe temperatures through periodic checks is sufficient.

Hot-held food temperatures for businesses that hold food above 63°C for service. Check periodically and record. Food that drops below 63°C should either be reheated to above 75°C or discarded within two hours.

## Allergen Management Under Natasha's Law

Since October 2021, Natasha's Law requires all food that is prepacked for direct sale (PPDS) — such as sandwiches, salads, and baked goods made and packaged on the premises — to carry a full ingredients list with the 14 major allergens emphasised in bold, italics, or highlighting.

Even for food that is not PPDS, you must be able to provide allergen information to customers on request. This means maintaining an allergen matrix for your menu, training all staff on allergen handling, and having procedures for preventing cross-contamination of allergens during food preparation.

Your SFBB pack should include an allergen management section. If your current pack predates Natasha's Law, download the updated version from food.gov.uk or create a supplementary allergen management document.

## Common HACCP Mistakes in Small Restaurants

The most common mistake is treating SFBB as a one-off document rather than a living system. Completing the safe methods section and then leaving the pack in a drawer for months defeats the purpose. Inspectors look for evidence of ongoing use: dated diary entries, completed 4-weekly reviews, and documented corrective actions when things go wrong.

The second most common mistake is generic rather than specific safe methods. Your SFBB should reflect your actual business operations. If you have a tandoori oven, your cooking procedures should mention it. If you serve sushi, your raw fish handling procedures should be detailed. Generic procedures suggest you copied the pack without thinking about your specific risks.

The third mistake is incomplete temperature records. Gaps in your temperature log tell inspectors that monitoring is inconsistent. Even if temperatures are always safe, the absence of records means you cannot prove it. Buy a bound logbook (not loose sheets, which can be lost or selectively removed) and record temperatures at the same times each day.

## When You Might Need Professional Help

Most small restaurants can implement SFBB themselves using the free FSA pack and guidance. However, you might benefit from professional help if you have a complex menu with high-risk preparations (such as raw fish, sous vide, or fermented foods), you have failed multiple inspections and cannot identify what needs to change, you are opening a new food business and want to get it right from the start, or your business handles significant allergen risks that require detailed procedures.

Environmental Health Consultants typically charge £500–£2,000 for a pre-inspection audit and HACCP implementation. For many small businesses, this investment pays for itself through improved ratings and avoided enforcement action.

## Get Your HACCP Priorities Right

HygieneFix analyses your specific inspection scores to identify which HACCP elements need the most attention.

    content: `## What Is Natasha's Law?

Natasha's Law — formally the Food Information (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2019, with equivalent legislation in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland — came into force on 1 October 2021. Named after Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, who died from an allergic reaction to a Pret A Manger baguette in 2016, the law requires all food that is prepacked for direct sale (PPDS) to carry a full ingredients list with the 14 major allergens clearly emphasised.

Before Natasha's Law, PPDS food only needed to have allergen information available on request. The new law requires this information to be physically present on the packaging, making it immediately visible to consumers without needing to ask. This is a significant change for businesses that make and package food on their premises for direct sale.

## What Counts as Prepacked for Direct Sale (PPDS)?

PPDS food is food that is packaged at the same premises where it is sold, before the consumer selects it. This includes sandwiches made and wrapped in a shop for customers to pick up, salads packaged in containers for self-service, baked goods wrapped for display, boxed meals prepared for collection, and any food packaged before a specific customer orders it.

PPDS does not include food packaged for a specific customer after they order it (this is "made to order" and has different requirements), food packaged at a different premises from where it is sold (this is "prepacked" and was already covered by existing labelling rules), or loose food sold without packaging (allergen information must still be available but does not need to be on a label).

The distinction matters because it determines which labelling requirements apply. If you are unsure whether your food is PPDS, the FSA provides detailed guidance and a decision tool on their website.

## The 14 Major Allergens

UK law identifies 14 allergens that must be declared on food labels and made available to consumers. These are celery, cereals containing gluten (wheat, rye, barley, oats), crustaceans, eggs, fish, lupin, milk, molluscs, mustard, nuts (almonds, hazelnuts, walnuts, cashews, pecans, brazils, pistachios, macadamia), peanuts, sesame, soybeans, and sulphur dioxide (at concentrations above 10mg/kg).

On PPDS labels, these allergens must be emphasised in the ingredients list using bold, italics, underlining, or a different colour — consistently throughout the label. The allergen name must appear as it is listed in the legislation (for example, "wheat" rather than just "flour").

## How to Comply

**Step 1: Audit your products.** List every PPDS item you sell and document its full ingredients, including sub-ingredients. A cheese sandwich requires listing the ingredients of the bread, butter, cheese, and any garnishes. If you use pre-made components (such as bought-in bread), obtain the full ingredient specifications from your supplier.

**Step 2: Create labels.** Every PPDS item must have a label showing the product name and a full ingredients list with allergens emphasised. The label must be physically attached to or clearly associated with the food. Handwritten labels are acceptable if they are legible and complete, though printed labels are strongly recommended for consistency.

**Step 3: Manage ingredient changes.** If you change a recipe or supplier, update your labels immediately. An out-of-date label is worse than no label — it provides false assurance. Implement a process for reviewing labels whenever ingredients change.

**Step 4: Train your staff.** All staff involved in preparing, packaging, or selling PPDS food must understand the labelling requirements. They should know which products contain which allergens, how to respond to allergen queries, and what to do if a labelling error is discovered. Document all training with dates and signatures.

**Step 5: Prevent cross-contamination.** Labelling is only effective if the food actually contains what the label says. Implement procedures to prevent cross-contamination during preparation: separate equipment for allergen-free items, cleaned surfaces between preparations, and clear workflows that minimise allergen transfer.

## Allergen Management Beyond PPDS

Even for food that is not PPDS, UK law requires you to provide allergen information to customers. For loose food (served without packaging), you must be able to tell customers which of the 14 allergens are present in each dish. This information can be provided verbally, on a menu, on a chalk board, or through any other clear method — but it must be available and accurate.

Create an allergen matrix for your full menu. This is a grid showing each dish against each allergen, with clear markings for "contains", "may contain" (for cross-contamination risks), and "does not contain". Display this matrix where staff can reference it and where customers can see it. Update it whenever your menu changes.

## Enforcement and Penalties

Allergen labelling is enforced by local authority Environmental Health Officers and Trading Standards Officers. Non-compliance can result in an improvement notice (requiring you to fix the issue within a specified timeframe), a fixed penalty notice, and in cases where non-compliance causes harm, prosecution under the Food Safety Act 1990 or the Food Information Regulations 2014.

More practically, allergen compliance is assessed as part of your food hygiene inspection. Poor allergen management will lower your confidence in management score, directly reducing your FHRS rating. Given that allergen management demonstrates proactive food safety management, strong compliance can actually improve your overall rating.

## Impact on Your Food Hygiene Rating

Environmental Health Officers now routinely assess allergen management during food hygiene inspections. They will ask about your allergen procedures, check your allergen information provision, and may quiz staff on their allergen knowledge. Businesses that demonstrate strong allergen management — clear labelling, maintained allergen matrices, trained staff, and documented procedures — signal the kind of proactive management that inspectors reward with higher confidence in management scores.

Conversely, businesses with poor allergen management face both lower FHRS ratings and potential enforcement action. This makes allergen compliance a double priority: it protects your customers and it protects your rating.

## Getting Started

If you are not currently compliant with Natasha's Law, start with an audit of your PPDS products and create accurate labels. Then build your allergen matrix for all menu items and train your staff. The FSA provides free resources, templates, and guidance at food.gov.uk/allergen-guidance.

  content: `## The SFBB Pack Is Excellent — But Generic

The Safer Food Better Business (SFBB) pack, published by the Food Standards Agency, is one of the best free food safety resources available to UK businesses. It covers all the key food safety procedures in plain English, provides a diary for ongoing record-keeping, and is the standard that Environmental Health Officers expect to see during inspections.

We recommend every food business download and complete it. HygieneFix is not a replacement for SFBB — it is a complement to it.

The limitation of SFBB is that it is generic. The same pack is used by a high-street café in Bristol and a late-night takeaway in Leeds. It covers all the food safety procedures but does not tell you which ones are most important for your specific situation. If you scored 20 out of 30 on management but only 5 out of 25 on hygiene, your priorities are very different from a business with the opposite scores.

## What HygieneFix Does Differently

HygieneFix starts with your actual inspection data. When you enter your postcode or business name, we pull your real scores from the FSA register: your hygiene score, structural score, and management score. We then generate a personalised action plan calibrated to your specific weaknesses.

A business scoring poorly on food handling hygiene receives detailed temperature control, cross-contamination, and cooking temperature guidance — with specific advice for their business type (a Chinese takeaway receives different guidance from a sandwich shop). A business scoring poorly on management receives SFBB implementation steps, documentation checklists, and training requirements — prioritised by impact on their specific score.

The SFBB pack tells you what good practice looks like. HygieneFix tells you what to fix first, second, and third based on where you actually lost marks.

## Side-by-Side Comparison

**Coverage:** SFBB covers all food safety procedures. HygieneFix covers only the improvements needed for your specific situation — making it focused rather than comprehensive. Both are needed: SFBB for the full system, HygieneFix for the prioritised action list.

**Specificity:** SFBB is one-size-fits-all. HygieneFix is calibrated to your exact scores, business type, and local authority. A rating-2 restaurant and a rating-2 takeaway receive different action plans because their inspection patterns differ.

**Priority ordering:** SFBB presents procedures without priority ranking. HygieneFix orders improvements by impact — critical items first, then high, medium, and low priority. This helps businesses with limited time and budget focus on the changes that will most improve their rating.

**Reinspection guidance:** SFBB does not cover how to request a reinspection, what fees to expect, or how to prepare for the specific assessment process. HygieneFix includes reinspection advice tailored to your local authority, including typical timelines and preparation checklists.

**Allergen compliance:** The original SFBB pack predates Natasha's Law. While updated versions exist, many businesses still have older packs. HygieneFix always includes current allergen management requirements, including PPDS labelling obligations.

**Cost:** SFBB is free. HygieneFix is £49 for a one-off personalised action plan. For a business facing delivery platform removal, enforcement action, or customer loss, the return on a £49 investment is typically measured in days of recovered revenue.

## When to Use Each

Use SFBB as your ongoing food safety management system. Complete the pack, maintain the diary, and review it every four weeks. This is the foundation that inspectors expect.

Use HygieneFix when you have received a low rating (0, 1, or 2) and need to know what to fix first. The personalised plan identifies your specific weaknesses and creates a prioritised roadmap to improve your rating before your next inspection or reinspection request.

The combination of both — a completed SFBB system plus a HygieneFix action plan for your specific gaps — gives you the strongest possible position for achieving a rating of 4 or 5.
